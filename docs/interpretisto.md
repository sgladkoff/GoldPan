## Interpretisto: The video conferencing and remote simultaneous interpreting platform that lets you conduct conference calls and host online and onsite events with simultaneous interpretation

Interpretisto is the video conferencing and remote simultaneous interpreting platform that lets you conduct conference calls and host online and onsite events with simultaneous interpretation. The platform offers enhanced security and confidentiality because it doesn't rely on public RSI services.

* Two-in-one communication service: Video conferencing + remote simultaneous interpreting
* Security: No public RSI service is used. The platform is built on its own RSI server and the backend, and can be installed on a single machine inside protected network perimeter of the client, so audio and video don't go to a public server.
* Ease of use: All you need is a Web browser. You don't need to install any desktop or mobile software. The browser-based service offers a highly adaptive interface that meets the needs of various user roles.
* Communication features: Links to "meeting rooms" that can be sent out to participants via e-mail with the date and time of the scheduled event; group chat; screen sharing; and interpreting language selector.
* Interpreting: The platform provides multichannel audio streaming to support simultaneous translation into several languages in parallel. Interpreters have their own standard controls. So, they can see and chat with each other, pass control and be on-air. They can mute and even see public-event chat.
