## Memose: Cloud-based Translation Memory and new generation CAT tool

You prepare and clean TM files and then you may store them on your local machine or your company file server. But that is of course an old way of previous century.

The smart way is to use TM Server to keep clean TMs as a central source of knowledge and reuse for yourself and/or your organization.

Logrus Global has a solution for that - it's called **Memose**. With **Memose** you can centralize the storage of TMs, do search, manage your TMs in one common centralized place in your own Memose cloud,  prepare project memory for CAT tool of your choosing, and even translate and edit `.xliff` files! If you want to try Memose, send an email to marcom @ logrusglobal.com.
