# Interpretisto: the simultaneous interpreting platform

**Interpretisto** is a platform that enables you to conduct conference calls and host online and onsite events with simultaneous interpretation.

We offer enhanced security and confidentiality, without reliance on public RSI services.

- Two-in-one communication service: Video conferencing + remote simultaneous interpreting.
- Security: No public RSI service is used. The platform is built on its own RSI server and backend, and can be installed on a single machine inside the client's protected network. No audio/video data goes out to a public server.
- Ease of use: As a conference attendee in any posible role, all you need is a web browser. There's no need to install any desktop or mobile software. The browser-based service offers a highly adaptive interface that meets the needs of various user roles.
- Communication features: Links to **Interpretisto** Meeting Rooms can be sent out to participants via e-mail, with the date and time of the scheduled event. Group chat, screen sharing and interpreting language selection features are available.
- Interpreting: The platform provides multichannel audio streaming to support simultaneous translation into several languages in parallel. Interpreters have their own standard controls. They are able to see each other, communicate, pass controls, be on air at different times, and see the public event chat.

## Before You Start

An Internet connection with a 5 mbps up/down (or higher) bandwidth is recommended, with a Firefox 60+ or a Chrome 74+ web browser.

If you have a speaking role, connect your headset and camera and enable your browser to access them prior to entering **Interpretisto**. 

Choose an environment without background noise, and with good lighting if you're using a camera. Remember to keep your microphone muted until it's your turn to speak.

You can log in to an existing conference simply by using an Interpretisto link you have been provided. Depending on your role, you may be asked to provide a username or an interpreting language.

If you've been provided a conference code instead of a link, you can enter it in the **Enter Conference Code** field.

## Conference Roles

**Interpretisto** enables its users to participate in conferences in a variety of roles. The role each user gets is determined by the link or code provided to them.

### Presenter

The role for a presenter during a webinar-style conference.

As a **Presenter**, you can stream your video and audio, as well as share your screen. You cannot see or hear other participants or access the chat.

If you are a **Presenter**, you won't be asked to provide any extra information when logging in.

### Participant

The role for an equal participant during a meeting-style conference.

As a **Participant**, you can stream your video and audio, as well as share your screen. You can see and hear what the other participants are streaming in video and audio, as well as access the chat.

If the conference has interpretation enabled, you will be able to choose your preferred language in order to filter out the users with the **Interpreter** role that are translating into that language. Any other audio will be reduced in volume to 30%, by default (you can change this in the Options).

If you are a **Participant**, you will be asked to provide a username when logging in.

### Interpreter

The role of an interpreter, essential for any multilingual conference.

As an **Interpreter**, you can stream audio in a specific language channel. You can see and hear what the users with the **Presenter** and **Participant** roles are streaming in video and audio, as well as monitor the chat.

**Interpreters** belonging to the same language pair can talk privately. They can see and hear each other, and have access to a special chat, exclusive to the **Interpreters** of their language pair.

If you are an **Interpreter**, you will be asked to provide a username and select a langauge pair when logging in.
