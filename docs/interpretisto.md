# Interpretisto: the simultaneously interpreted video conference platform

Interpretisto is a platform that enables you to conduct conference calls and host online and onsite events with simultaneous interpretation.

It offers enhanced security and confidentiality, as it doesn't rely on public RSI services.

- Two-in-one communication service: Video conferencing + remote simultaneous interpreting.
- Security: No public RSI service is used. The platform is built on its own RSI server and backend, and can be installed on a single machine inside the client's protected network. No audio/video data goes out to a public server.
- Ease of use: All you need is a web browser. No need to install any desktop or mobile software. The browser-based service offers a highly adaptive interface that meets the needs of various user roles.
- Communication features: Links to Interpretisto Meeting Rooms can be sent out to participants via e-mail with the date and time of the scheduled event. Group chat, screen sharing and interpreting language selection features are available.
- Interpreting: The platform provides multichannel audio streaming to support simultaneous translation into several languages in parallel. Interpreters have their own standard controls. They are able to see each other, communicate, pass controls, be on air at different times, and see the public event chat.
