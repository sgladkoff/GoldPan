# The TermLode Application Family

The **TermLode** application family is a client-server, cloud-based terminology database solution designed for corporate use.

It is comprised of the following applications:

- The **TermLode** terminology database;
- The **Omnitran** Search application;
- The **Prospector** Terminology extractor;
- The **TermLode** Trados connector.

In the sense of achitecture, it has the following components:

- The **TermLode** termbank;
- The **TermLode** Cloud Front End;
- The **Omnitran** Cloud Front End;
- The **Prospector** Cloud Front End;
- The **TermLode** **Trados** Connector DLL.

## Data Model

The **TermLode** data model conforms to the TBX standard (ISO 30042). Thereâ€™s a Concept in the root hierarchy, and terms in various languages are descendants from the root, as shown on the figure:

![termlode_f1](termlode_f1.png)

There's a One-to-Many relationship between a **Concept** and multiple **Terms** is any language, and a Many-to-Many relationship between **Terms** in different languages. This data model reflects the situation when one source term can have several terms for a target language and vice versa.

## User Experience

### TermLode

As you enter the **TermLode** page, the **Terminology Database Manager** will be the first screen you see. 

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_1.png)

This screen displays all the **termbases** available to you, grouped by company name. Company names (1), as well as the **termbases**' own names (2) may be used to filter the list of **termbases**.

By default, the **Database Manager** screen is in the **termbase** listing mode. Using the menu (3), you can switch between that and the **termbase** creation mode:

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_2.png)

You can simply enter the name of the new **termbase**, pick the source and target languages and press the **Create New Termbase** button to create a new empty **termbase**.

Click the name of a **termbase** to enter the **Terminology Database** screen:

The **Term Filter** takes up the top of the screen. It can use any of the variables that make up a term to populate the **List of Terms** below:

- Source strings and languages;
- Target strings and languages;
- Business domains that terms belong belongs to;
- Term types (acronym, concept etc.);
- Parts of speech that are used as terms;
- Prouducts that the terms belong to;
- Modules;

The **Apply Filter** button populates a new **List of Terms** in accordance with the **Term Filter** settings.

The **Term Filter** also includes the **Export** and **Export TBX** buttons that are used to create and download a XLSX or a TBX file (respectively) containing the terms from the filtered **List of Terms**.

The **List of Terms** will show a One-to-Many relationship between the source term and the target terms in multiple languages if the **Term Filter**  is set up for multiple target languages. When you click a source term in the **List of Terms**, the Edit dialog box opens and shows the full multilingual One-to-Many hierarhy - from the **Concept** down to the **Terms** in various languages. You can add new **Terms** in any of the languages already present, or select a new language for adding a term.

### OmniTran

The **TermLode** data model organizes collections of **Terms** into **Glossaries** by client, as well as by topic. **Omnitran**, a glocal search front end web interface, enables you to carry out searches for a **Term** across multiple **Glossaries** at once.

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_8.png)

You can select just a single **Glossary** or source/target language, or any number of them at once. You can also view one of the selected **Glossaries** as a collection of alphabetical sections by pressing the **A-Z** button:
